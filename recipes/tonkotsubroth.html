    <h2>What is tonkotsu broth?</h2>
    <p>Tonkotsu broth is a soup base used when making ramen that's made by boiling pork bones for hours to achieve a thick, milky texture. It's typically flavoured with shoyu (soy sauce) to add a salty and umami taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (for four)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb pork feet</li>
        <li>1lb pork neck</li>
        <li>6 cups room temperature water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot half-full with water and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Add the pork feet and neck. Scoop out whatever rises to the top until you don't see any more scum - this will take 20-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the pork bones and clean the pot. Thoroughly wash each bone and add them back to the pot with the water from the ingredients list.</li>
        <li>Boil for 6-10 hours; the longer you boil, the more viscous the broth will be. Keep adding water as the amount in the pot decreases. Stir every 15-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the contents of the pot to leave you with just a liquid broth.</li>
    </ol>
